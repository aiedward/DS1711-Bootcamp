    "3. Know how to search for useful information and help from related website. You can receive a lot of beautiful insights from the Discussion of the competition.\n",

    "2. Please **focus more on feature extractions** in this homework, if your time is limited, you don't need to realize all your thoughts, but you need to spend sometime to think about this and give us several thoughts among those you don't realize.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This is just a homework, **you don't need to persue the perfect work if your time is limited**, since it will cost you a lot of time to improve it to a relatively good model. Again, this homework is just to nurture your basic sense of doing Kaggle. The real battle will come soon, that's the Kaggle competition you need to spend a lot of time and energies on."
